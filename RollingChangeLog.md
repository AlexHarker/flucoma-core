# 1.0.0-RC1
date: 

## New Features:
* BREAKING CHANGE: (buf)melbands how has normalised amplitude output option, on by default, which is independent of window and fft size
* (buf)NoveltySlice now has a minimum slice length parameter
* BREAKING CHANGE: (buf)sines now have new parameter names, and a new option to select which algorithm is used to track the sines. It also has improved sound quality and more refined thresholding.
* BREAKING CHANGE: (buf)AmpSlice is now 2 objects, (buf)AmpGate for the absolute, and (buf)AmpSlice for the relative
* (buf)AmpSlice and (buf)AmpGate has 0Hz highpassfreq to bypass the high pass filter.

## Bug Fixes:
* (Pd on Windows) now works ;-)
* BREAKING CHANGE: buf* processes now use the buffer's sampling rate (or the SR attribute for Pd)
* BREAKING CHANGE: (buf)ampslice now works much faster and consistently but thresholds and times will have to be tweaked
* (Pd) BREAKING CHANGE: all non-real-time (buf) objects have lost the tilde (~) in their name to be consistent with the language conventions.
* BREAKING CHANGE: (buf)OnsetSlice latency reporting (rt) and offset (buf) are now more accurate but will have changed for similar threshold
* BREAKING CHANGE: (buf)NoveltySlice latency reporting (rt) and offset (buf) are now more accurate but will have changed for similar threshold
* (buf)HPSS speed is improved
* Many edge cases were found and sorted.
* (Max) parameters updates now behave all the time in real-time
* (SC) BREAKING CHANGE: bufnmf's audio output destination buffer is renamed properly to resynth

## Improvements:
* (Pd+CLI) documentation is now more accurate and consistently formatted
* cross reference between documents (see also)
* credits, references and acknowledgements are streamlined and consistent
* (Pd) better code for pinknoise abstraction

## New Example:
* (SC+Pd) most Max examples are now ported to the two other CCEs
* (SC) Gerard's GUI demos of algorithms are now available

## Known Bugs:
* bufnmf progress output in multithreading mode (blocking 0) does not output progress.
* (Mac) Notarization is not implemented yet since most CCEs are working on workarounds

* (Max) Help patches better at making sound straight out of the box
* (CLI) Some audio file format were wrong polarity, now sorted
* (CLI) Mangled wav files on windows sorted
* all: many little tweaks here and there, more stable and consistent documentation

## New Example:
* (all) nb_of_slice is updated and more intelligent

## Known Bugs:
* BufNoveltySlice might generate garbage strange values in the first frame

- All parameters of are now modulatable - new maxima parameters to set the ranges of those modulations are instantiation only.
- BREAKING CHANGE (MAX): fft parameters are now a single list
- BREAKING CHANGE: all parameters have been renamed in a consistent, verbose way.
- Warning attribute for all objects (in max, window, in SC turn verbose up (see manual)): reports warnings when attribute values try to go out of range

## Bug Fixes:
- complete C++ code rewrite under the hood, therefore many, many fixes and some likely new bugs

## Known Bugs Still Unfixed:
- MAX: autocompletion of @arguments and in/outlet assist strings are on their way, but not yet implemented.
